#### Ginkgo v2

You need to replace `github.com/onsi/ginkgo` with `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2`.
Run `go mod tidy` and make sure all imports have been replaced.

#### Resource labels

Since v3.7.0, the metadata labels are added to all resources.
This patch contains an example name, so you need to replace `kubebuilder-updates` with your repository name.

```yaml
app.kubernetes.io/created-by: kubebuilder-updates
app.kubernetes.io/part-of: kubebuilder-updates
app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
```
